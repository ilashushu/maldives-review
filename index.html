  <h2>Review of Dhigufaru Island Resort</h2>
<p class="normal-text">Hello everyone. We are reposting a deleted review. Apparently, due to the increased interest in Maldives vacations for New Year, our previous posts were removed. So we are publishing it here again.</p>

<div class="media-block">
  <h3>Unitours</h3>
  <p class="normal-text">— through this agency we purchased a voucher from Coraltravel.</p>

<p class="highlight">
  We filed a complaint.<br>
  Left the island earlier than planned.<br>
  The agents **** promised us they would resolve something.<br>
  <strong>We are repeating the review:<strong><br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>No coconuts at all — not even for money.</strong> In a five-star hotel — not a single coconut (even for purchase). Welcome to the Maldives!</span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>No cappuccino or latte for breakfast: coffee machine had been broken for days. Coffee available only for $8 per cup.</strong></span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>One small pool on the entire island (only 1.2 meters deep). For “five stars” this is a joke.</strong></span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>No entertainment, no entertainers. A volleyball net on the sand is apparently considered “infrastructure”.</strong></span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>Almost no wildlife: a small corner with 4 rays and 7 sharks, seemingly brought in artificially. Flora was disappointing — no flowers, no lush greenery, no trees like on other islands.</strong></span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>One path across the island. After four days, it became exhausting to look at. The store is 12 square meters and only open three times a day for two hours. Wi-Fi is unstable: you need to run around the room to find a signal. If it were stable, enduring the chaos would have been easier. Figuring out how to get to Malé was nearly impossible — reception provided no information unless you showed up with your suitcase ready to go.</strong></span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>We mainly eat vegetables, so we are not picky — but other guests were unhappy with the food. Overall: 3 out of 5. Cleaning around the rooms only happened after our calls. Before that, there were cans, wrappers, and food scraps — as if we were feeding cockroaches on purpose.</strong></span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>Blinds in the room didn’t open, the window was sealed shut — no way to ventilate the room.</strong></span></li>
  <li><span class="normal-text"><strong>There’s only one restaurant, and it was closed. No Russian-speaking staff. SPA is another story: we went once, and it was enough. Expensive and ineffective (my wife, for the first time, refused to leave a tip).</strong></span></li>
</ul>

  <h3>The Shallowest Sea</h3>
  <p>Each morning we hoped to enjoy a proper swim in the sea, as one would expect from a high-class resort. However, due to the shallow shoreline, even after walking 200 meters into the water, the depth remained waist-level. This created inconvenience for those expecting a more comfortable and relaxing swimming experience.</p>

  <h3>1. Chlorine in the Pool</h3>
  <p>One morning, chlorine was dumped directly into the pool. When we asked why they were doing it during the day, the staff explained that the pump had been broken for days and everything would “dissolve in a couple of hours” — which turned out to be false. The chlorine only cleared by evening.</p>

  <h3>2. Neighbor Renovations</h3>
  <p>On January 6th, a renovation started in the neighboring room — at 3:30 PM the entire island echoed with the sound of saws. The noise was so intense I nearly kicked the workers out of our unit. Naturally, there were no apologies from management.</p>

  <h3>3. Ocean Villa Relocation</h3>
  <p>In the middle of our stay, we were unexpectedly moved to an “ocean villa” — allegedly for a change of scenery. At first, we thought it was a nice surprise. It turned out they simply needed our room. The “new” villa was a nightmare: slippery and unsafe stairs to the sea, unstable wooden railing, doors that rattled in the wind, and a leaking roof over the veranda. We couldn’t sleep. We asked to move back to our original villa — the one we paid for. They told us to wait a day. The next day: “no more rooms in your category.” Our villa was simply reassigned to someone else.</p>

  <h3>4. Back to Original Villa & Chaotic 4 Days</h3>
  <p>Two days later, we were moved back to a (run-down, barely habitable) room in our category. The first day — no electricity or air conditioning. Things got worse: broken blinds, cracked floor — walking to the toilet at night became dangerous. The pool smelled strongly of chlorine, burning our eyes. To top it off — the door opened without any key!</p>

  <h3>5. All Inclusive Discussion</h3>
  <p>Four days of utter chaos. We spent hours sitting in the bar with our luggage waiting for updates. For all the inconvenience, we were promised “complimentary All Inclusive.” In the end, they charged us for it. Even for items we never ordered. No signatures. No consent. They simply deducted it from the deposit.</p>

  <h3>6. Why No Electricity?</h3>
  <p>Repair work in our room (January 7th). Once again, we were without electricity (and air conditioning), and were moved to another temporary room for the day. By this point, it was our fourth room change during the trip!</p>

  <h3>7. Surprise Repair Crew</h3>
  <p>Upon moving again, we discovered that our “temporary” room was already under repair. Four workers were busy in the bathroom, the room was a mess, and access to the toilet was blocked. No one informed or warned us. No apologies.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Our vacation was certainly memorable — though not always in the best ways. Dealing with management here is not for the faint of heart — I had to stand my ground. Ironically, that was the most effort I made during a supposed “rest.”<br>
  All our complaints and frustrations had one response: “please wait a few more days, we’ll resolve everything.” In reality — requesting a refund turned into a circus. We sent emails, wrote formal complaints, tried to follow the rules — but the hotel delayed responses, requested rewording, and invented reasons for postponement. Everything looked like “a process,” but in truth — it was just evasion.<br>
  In the end, they replied with the final blow: “we can’t help you.” And quietly, the legal claim window expired. That’s the kind of “vacation” we had.<br>Help us resolve this misunderstanding.</p>
